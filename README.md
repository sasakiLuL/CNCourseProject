# Network Routing Simulation â€“ Course Project

This project is a simulation tool for modeling data transmission in a computer network.  
It allows users to create a custom network topology, configure links and nodes, and simulate traffic flow.

### Key Features

- Visual graph editor for building and editing the network
- Simulation of data transmission using a **modified Ford-Fulkerson algorithm**
- Support for **duplex, half-duplex, and satellite channels**
- Performance analysis including packet delay, route tables, and traffic stats
- Developed in **C# using WPF** with a clean MVVM architecture

This tool is designed for educational purposes to study how routing and network topologies affect data flow efficiency.
